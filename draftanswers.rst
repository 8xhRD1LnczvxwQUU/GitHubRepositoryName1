		2.1	Please provide a description of the e-money services that the applicant firm intends to provide

				You must include a breakdown of the:

					- e-money issuance; 
					- [e-money] distribution; 
					- [e-money] redemption;
					- payment services linked to the e-money.
					
				.. Note::

					We are an foreign exchange ("FX") and international payments company, and intend to offer our clients the facility of currency wallets.  We currently operate in twenty-three currencies.

					(e-money issuance)
					Customers may make bank transfers of cleared funds to our client segregated accounts held by The Currency Cloud Limited ("Currency Cloud", FCA AEMI ref. no. 900199) or ClearBank limited ("ClearBank" FCA Authorised ref. no. 754568).  

					We intend to issue e-money on receipt of cleared funds in equivalent denomination and amount as the cleared fiat currency ("Wallet Balance").

					(e-money distribution)
					We intend to store all e-money issued in all denominations and amounts in the Midpoint platform ("Treasury System").  The client may then view their Treasury System or to make a claim for a payment service.

					(e-money redemption)
					The e-money issued by us can be used for:

					   - a claim on us to initiate a domestic/international bank transfer in fiat currency; 
					   - a claim on us to settle an FX conversion instrument.
					
					The e-money issued by us is not redeemable at any other third-party service providers, i.e. the client can redeem their Wallet Balance with Midpoint only. 

					(payment services linked to the e-money)
